## üè∑Ô∏è Introduce

In the fields of security monitoring and autonomous driving, low-light conditions pose significant challenges to the performance of visual sensors. To mitigate this issue, this paper presents a method for converting infrared to visible light images called Thermal2Sense. The approach is based on the technical routes of diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and utilizes a two-stage inference process to optimize the quality of image reconstruction. In the first stage, Thermal2Sense employs a dedicated Controlnet module to reconstruct images with random noise input, ensuring structural consistency with the infrared image. The second stage additionally introduces an IP-Adapter module and Canny Controlnet, leveraging semantic knowledge from pre-trained models for semantic reconstruction at the detail level while maintaining overall structural and color control.

## ‚è¨ Model weights
The model will be automatically downloaded through the following two lines:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
ConsistentID_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="JackAILab/ConsistentID", filename="ConsistentID-v1.bin", repo_type="model")
```

The pre-trained model parameters of the model can also be downloaded on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCHICryESmNkzGi8J_FlY3PjJz9gqoSI/view?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NAVmH8S7Ls5rZc-snDk1Ng?pwd=nsh6).
